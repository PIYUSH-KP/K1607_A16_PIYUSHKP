Operating System: Dynamic Priority Scheduler


 This is a scheduler program that uses a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm based on dynamically changing priority.
 Larger number for priority indicates higher priority.
 When the process starts execution (i.e. CPU assigned), priority for that process changes at the rate of m=1.When the process waits for CPU   in the ready queue (but not yet started execution), its priority changes at a rate n=2.
 All the processes are initially assigned priority value of 0 when they enter ready queue for the first time.
